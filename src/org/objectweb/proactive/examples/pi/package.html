algorithm. In the config drectory you will find specific configuration files for ProActive(especialy for the p2p version of pi).
In the descriptors directory there are all the different deployment descriptors used to deploy the PI computation. 
The doc directory contains some information about the algorithm used in this version of PI computation and some information about this tutorial.
The fractal directory contains ADL descriptions for the component version of the PI computation.
The onthefly folder contains files that help deploying this example using file transfer.
The scripts folder contains scripts to compile and execute this example.
The serverconf directory contains configuration files used to expose this example as a web service.
To run this example, you need to execute the build or the build.bat script. You need to put "run" as first argument.
