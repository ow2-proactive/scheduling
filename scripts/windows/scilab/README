ProActive Extension for Scilab.

Before being able to use the extension and launch the GUI (scilab.sh or scilab.bat), please follow these installations steps.


STEP 1: Download Scilab 4.1.2 or above BINARY Version

If you can't download version 4.1.2 please follow step 2.


STEP 2 (source version only): Download Scilab SOURCE version 4.1 or 4.1.1

copy javasci_Scilab2.h and javasci_Scilab2.c from folder c_sources to SCILAB/routines/Javasci/

make binaries of Scilab (procedure is explained  in SCILAB/Readme_Linux or SCILAB/Readme_Windows)


STEP 3:
Edit paths to your SCILAB installation in the scilab_env.sh or scilab_env.bat file

Comment out the following line if present in the SCILAB/scilab.star file (should be around line 190):
show_startupinfo();

To comment out just insert "//" in the beginning of the line like in Java.  


STEP 4: 
Read documentation on http://proactive.inria.fr/scilab.htm on how to use the GUI

Edit paths inside the ProActiveScilab.xml descriptor if you want to use it to deploy on remote machines, if you want to deploy locally use the ProActiveScilabLocal.xml descriptor


STEP 5:
Run scilab.sh or scilab.bat. 



ATTENTION :

If you want to use the extension without the script, remember two things :

Under Linux, the environment variables must be set according to the scilab_env.sh script AND the java property java_library_path must contain the directory where the libjavasci.so can be found

Under Windows, the System PATH environment variable(and not the user PATH) must contain the path to where the libjavasci.so can be found
               OR, the application must be launched next to it
