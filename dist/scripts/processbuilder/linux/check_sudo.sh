  ###### DEVELOPER NOTE:
  #	In case the 'suer' solution does not meet all requirements, it is possible to conveniently replace
  #	it with a solution built on the Expect library. We need just a script which could interpret the 'su'
  #	messages. Since expect mixes together the error and output channels, a named pipe should be used to
  #	forward the error of the inner commands to the outside world. This named pipe could be created in the
  #	temp directory, and deleted when the scripts exit.
