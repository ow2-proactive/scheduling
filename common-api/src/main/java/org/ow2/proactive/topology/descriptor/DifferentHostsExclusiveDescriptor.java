/**
 * This descriptor allows to select one node per host exclusively.
 * Hosts with selected nodes will be reserved for the user.
 *
 * By specifying this descriptor in {@link ResourceManager.getAtMostNodes} user may get
 * more nodes than it asked for due to the fact that total capacity of all machines is
 * bigger.
 *
 * The resource manager first will try to find hosts with only one node
 * to optimize the utilization of resources. If there no such hosts (or their quantity is
 * below required) it will continue looking for hosts with 2 nodes and so on.
 *
 * If number of hosts is not enough the found subset will be provided.
