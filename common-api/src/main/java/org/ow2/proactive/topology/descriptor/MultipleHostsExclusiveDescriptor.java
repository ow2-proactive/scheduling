/**
 * This descriptor allows to select nodes on multiple hosts exclusively.
 * Hosts with selected nodes will be reserved for the user.
 *
 * By specifying this descriptor in {@link ResourceManager.getAtMostNodes} user may get
 * more nodes than it asked for due to the fact that total capacity of all machines is
 * bigger (even thought the resource manager tries to find the optimal set of host
 * minimizing the waist of resources), namely
 *
 * if user requested k nodes
 *
 * - if one machine exists with the capacity k it will be selected
 * - if several machines give exact number of nodes they will be selected
 *   (in case of several possibilities number of machines will be minimized)
 * - if it not possible to find exact number of nodes but it's possible to
 *   find more than they will be selected. The number of waisted resources
 *   & number of machines will be minimized
 * - otherwise less nodes will be provided but as the closest as possible to k
