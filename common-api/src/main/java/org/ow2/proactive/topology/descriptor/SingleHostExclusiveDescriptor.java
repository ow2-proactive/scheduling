/**
 * This descriptor allows to select nodes on the single hosts exclusively.
 * The host with selected nodes will be reserved for the user.
 *
 * By specifying this descriptor in {@link ResourceManager.getAtMostNodes} user may get
 * more nodes than it asked for due to the fact that total capacity of hosts is
 * bigger (even thought the resource manager tries to find the optimal host
 * minimizing the waist of resources), namely
 *
 * if user requested k nodes
 *
 * - the machine with exact capacity will be selected if exists
 * - the machine with bigger capacity will be selected if exists.
 *   The capacity of the selected machine will be the closest to k.
 * - the machine with smaller capacity than k will be selected.
 *   In this case the capacity of selected host will be the biggest among all other.
