You can download binaries and access a trial platform for free at:

## Quick start

To run ProActive Scheduler (server part):

    $> ./bin/proactive-server

This will start all components, including 4 local nodes and Web portals.
URLs to access them will be displayed in the server's output.

From here you can submit a job to the Scheduler, using for instance the
XML files in `samples/proactive-examples`.

To run the command line client:

    $> ./bin/proactive-client

To start a node:

    $> ./bin/proactive-node -r SCHEDULER_URL

## Building from sources

You can build a distribution that contains all binaries with `./gradlew build` (linux/mac) or `gradlew build` (windows).

This will produce the following archives:

    build/distributions/
    ├── scheduling-XXXXX-SNAPSHOT.tar
    └── scheduling-XXXXX-SNAPSHOT.zip
