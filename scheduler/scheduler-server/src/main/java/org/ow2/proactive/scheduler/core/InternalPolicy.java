/**
 * Implementation of the policy according that:
 * <ul>
 * 	<li>We try to keep scheduling policy order while it's not leading to starvation
 * 	(if first tasks to be started are finally not started because of bad selection script, we must go on next tasks but
 *  this situation could lead to run lower priority before normal or high or even mislead FIFO order.)</li>
 * 	<li>A specified number of tasks can be returned by this policy (NB_TASKS_PER_LOOP setting)</li>
 *  <li>This policy returns groups of tasks sequentially taken in the whole queue.
 *  Tasks that have just been returned are not returned by the next call to the policy until a predefined
 *  number of calls is reached (for example, if their are X tasks to schedule, the policy returns Y tasks, and there is Z nodes available,
 *  the policy will return X/Z groups of Y tasks AND THEN restart to get task from beginning of the queue.
 *  This will avoid starvation.</li>
 * </ul>
