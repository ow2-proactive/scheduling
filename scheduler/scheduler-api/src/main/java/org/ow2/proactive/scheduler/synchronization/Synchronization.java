/**
 * Synchronization provides a persistent <i>key/value store</i> API, similar to the {@link java.util.Map Map} interface.
 *
 * The Synchronization service is automatically started with the ProActive Server.
 *
 * <p>The key/value store is organized in <i>channels</i>. Each channel corresponds to a private key/value {@link java.util.HashMap HashMap}.
 * Synchronization provides an API to create or delete channel and decide if the channel should be persisted on disk (thus available on scheduler restart) or kept in memory only.</p>
 *
 * <p>Each map operation is performed on a given <i>channel</i>, with the channel name provided as parameter.</p>
 *
 * <p>The Synchronization API provides also additional map operations such as {@link #conditionalCompute conditionalCompute} to perform conditional operations based on the result of a {@link java.util.function.BiPredicate}, or wait operations such as {@link #waitUntil(String, String, String)} to block the caller until a given predicate is met.</p>
 *
 * <p>These <i>wait operations</i> allow the API to be used for synchronization and not only as a key/value store. The <i>Synchronization API</i> is notably used to synchronize parallel ProActive Tasks.</p>
 *
 * <p>Each map operation can be performed <b>remotely</b>, for example from <i>ProActive Workflow Tasks</i> executed inside <i>remote ProActive Nodes</i>.</p>
 *
 * <p>Each operation is as well <b>synchronous</b> and <b>atomic</b>, remote operations are received by the service and handled through a request queue.</p>
 *
 * <p>Java 8 Map operations, based on lambdas, are allowed, but lambdas must be provided as String values containing <a href="http://groovy-lang.org/closures.html">Groovy Closures</a> expressions which match the corresponding java lambda.</p>
 *
 * <p>For example, to write a groovy closure which match a Java {@link java.util.function.BiFunction}:</p>
 *
 * <pre> {@code
 * "{ k, x -> x + 1 }"
 * }</pre>
