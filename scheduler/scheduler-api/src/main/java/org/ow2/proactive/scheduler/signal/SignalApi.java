/**
 * SignalApi uses the synchronization API store to provide a persistent <i>key/value channel</i> for job signals.
 *
 * SignalApi uses a single system channel to store all signals needed by jobs.
 * The signal channel contains an entry per job.
 * The key of each entry is the job id, whereas the value of the entry is the set of signals used by the considered job.
 *
 * The SignalApi service is automatically started with the ProActive Server.
