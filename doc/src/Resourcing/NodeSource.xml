		<para>
			The ProActive Resource Manager supports nodes aggregation from heterogeneous
			environments. As a node is just a JVM running somewhere, the process of communication
			to such nodes is unified and defined by ProActive library. The only part which has to
			be defined is the procedure of nodes deployment which could be quite different
			depending on infrastructures and their limitations.

			After <link linkend="rm-install">installation</link> of the server and node parts
			it is possible to configure an automatic nodes deployment.
			Basically, you can say to the resource manager how to launch JVMs with
			ProActive nodes and when.
		</para>

		<note><para>
			Lets give an example here. You have a cluster of linux-x64 machines
			permanently at your disposal with ssh access to all hosts
			and a cluster running Windows HPC where you would like
			to run computations periodically (let us say from 12 to 14 every day).
			In order to describe such a kind of behavior, we create 2 node sources
			using GUI or command line interface. The first one is the node source
			with "ssh infrastructure" and static deployment policy. The command would be
			the following:

			<screen><![CDATA[$RM_HOME>./bin/unix/rm-client --createns "MyCluster" -infrastructure org.ow2.proactive.resourcemanager.nodesource.infrastructure.SSHInfrastructure
rmURL sshOptions javaPath schedulingPath nodeTimeout attempt targetOS javaOptions rmCreds hostsList]]></screen>
			The semantic of this command is quite straight forward, namely the resource
			manager tries immediately to launch the command of JVM creation through ssh using a special
			class which creates ProActive nodes inside JVMs and register them in the resource manager.
			Static node acquisition is default and you do not have to explicitly specify it.
		</para>
		<para>
			The procedure of deployment on Windows HPC is more tricky because it involves the native scheduler
			and in order to take into account other users of the cluster, we have to go through it.
			Basically, what the resource manager does is contact the windows scheduler
			exposed as a web service (it requires additional configuration of windows cluster)
			and submit a job launching the JVM process with ProActive. Here we also describe
			when the deployment has to be triggered using time slot policy.

		</para>

		<para>
			As you can see in the example above, in order to create a node source, you have to define two entities
			<emphasis>infrastructure manager</emphasis> and
			<emphasis>node source policy</emphasis>.
		</para>
		<para>
			<emphasis>Infrastructure manager</emphasis> is responsible for communicating with an infrastructure.
			When a new node has to be deployed, an infrastructure manager will launch new JVM or just
			request an already existing nodes running somewhere. All these details are specific to the
			infrastructure manager implementation.
		</para>

		<warning><para>
			ProActive Scheduling supports only one node per JVM. So that if you're configuring
			the resource manager to be used with scheduler take it into account.
			In the following, the term "node" always
			refers to a <emphasis>single node deployed in a dedicated JVM.</emphasis>
		</para></warning>

					which is a number of tasks per node. In the same manner as the previous policy, this one also requires scheduler URL, 
					user name and password. It is important to correctly configure maximum and minimum nodes that this policy will try to hold. 
					Maximum number should not be greater than potential nodes number which is possible to deploy to underlying infrastructure. 
					If there are more currently acquired nodes than necessary, policy will release them one by one after having waited for a "release period" delay. 
					This smooth release procedure is implemented because deployment time is greater than the release one. 
					Thus, this waiting time deters policy from spending all its time trying to deploy nodes.

						<para><emphasis role="bold">loadFactor</emphasis> - number of tasks per node. Actually, if this number is <emphasis role="italics">N</emphasis>,
						it does not means that there will be exactly <emphasis role="italics">N</emphasis> tasks
						executed on each node. This factor is just used to compute the total number of nodes. For instance, let us assume that this factor is 3 and that we schedule 100
						tasks. In that case, we will have 34 (= upper bound of 100/3) started nodes. Once one task finished and the refresh time passed,
						one node will be removed since 99 divided by 3 is 33. When there will remain 96 tasks (assuming that no other tasks are scheduled meanwhile),
						an other node will be removed at the next calculation time, and so on and so forth... </para>

					<listitem>
						<para><emphasis role="bold">releaseDelay</emphasis> - Delay between each node release. This time is useful since the deploying time is important.
						Let us assume that a node has to be removed. If this releaseDelay did not exist (or if it was set to 0),
						this node would be removed instantaneously. Let us assume assume that right after this
						removal, another task is scheduled, requiring a new node. In that case, we would lose a lot of time removing the previous node and deploying another one
						whereas the task could have been scheduled on the same node. This releaseDelay therefore represents the time to wait before effectively removing a node.</para>

				<para>
					The resource manager provides the way to create your own custom policy or infrastructure.
					In order to do it:
				</para>
				<itemizedlist>
					<listitem>
						<para>First implement you policy extending from <emphasis role="bold">org.ow2.proactive.resourcemanager.nodesource.policy.NodeSourcePolicy</emphasis>
						or infrastructure extending from <emphasis role="bold">org.ow2.proactive.resourcemanager.nodesource.infrastructure.InfrastructureManager</emphasis>.
						To add the parameter which will be visible in GUI/CLI just put <emphasis role="bold">@Configurable</emphasis> annotation to the corresponding field.</para>
					</listitem>
					<listitem>
						<para>Second put you classes into <emphasis role="bold">$RMHOME/addons</emphasis> directory so that the resource manager will find them.</para>
					</listitem>
					<listitem>
						<para>And finally update the configuration file. For newly created policy put the name into
						<emphasis role="bold">$RMHOME/config/rm/nodesource/policies</emphasis>. For the infrastructure do the same
						in  <emphasis role="bold">$RMHOME/config/rm/nodesource/infrastructures</emphasis>.</para>
					</listitem>
				</itemizedlist>
				<para>
					When you start the resource manager your infrastructure/policy will be in the list of supported ones.
