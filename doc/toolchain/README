Version 0.6
=Changes=

Added  a checkstyle folder with configuration files and the corresponding
macros for checking the javadoc style and the java files header. The
checkstyle jar file should be present in the compile/lib folder in the
project being checked.

See http://checkstyle.sourceforge.net/


Version 0.5

=Changes=
Upgraded the DocBook version to the latest 1.74.3 version  and
removed any unnecessary xsl stylesheets from the DocBook distribution. The
resulting folder is 2.6 Mb in size. Also some unused jar files were removed
with the purpose of making the toolchain smaller. The XML catalog was removed in order 
to simplify the toolchain as the XSL transformations are done both through
Java and Ant XSL and the configuration is more complex than necessary when
using catalogs. 
The DocBook zip file was removed and replaced with the docbook-xsl folder. The 
necessary XSL files are now included from the docbook-xsl folder through 
regular <xsl:import>.

Version 0.3

=Changes=
Added a file (doc_macros.xml)  containing  target macros. Replaced
the contents of doc.xml with a generic installation file which needs
to be edited when creating a new manual (see INSTALL).
Java XML validation (Validate class) was replaced  with ant XML 
validation. For this  ant-nodeps.jar was added in the lib folder and the
Validate class was removed from doc-utils.jar.  The validation now shows
the file with the error (line, column) instead of a line and column in
tmp/main.xml. Also, the build stops if the XML file is invalid.

Version 0.2
=Changes=

Ant targets added
 clean              Deletes the generated files
 compile.doc.utils  Compile Documentation Utils
 jar.doc.utils      Builds a jar containing the documentation java helper classes
 toolchain          Builds and copies the toolchain in ./built                   

The DocBook folder has been removed and replaced with a zip archive containing the files.
The java class files are now supplied as  lib/doc-utils.jar instead being built when building
the documentation. The "src" folder (java files) has been removed from the built toolchain as
is now longer necessary.
