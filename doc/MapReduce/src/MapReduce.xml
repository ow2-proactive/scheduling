        <para>
            MapReduce is a parallel programming model that derives from the <emphasis>map</emphasis>
            and <emphasis>reduce</emphasis> combinators present in functional languages like
            Lisp. In Lisp, the <emphasis>map</emphasis> takes as input a function and a sequence of
            values.  It then applies the function to each value in the sequence. The
            <emphasis>reduce</emphasis> combines all the elements of a sequence using a binary
            operation. For example, it can use the sum function to add up all the elements in a
            sequence. MapReduce is inspired by these concepts.

        <para>
            MapReduce was first introduced by <trademark class="registered">Google</trademark> as a
            framework for processing large amounts of raw data, for example, web pages collected by
            a web crawler or web request logs, using clusters of commodity hardware. The amount of
            data is so large that it must be distributed across thousands of machines in order to be
            processed in a reasonable time. The distribution implies parallel computing since the
            same computations are performed on each CPU, but with a different dataset.
        </para>
        <para>
            MapReduce is an abstraction that allows Google engineers to perform simple computations
            while hiding the details of parallelization, data distribution, load balancing and fault
            tolerance. MapReduce programs are automatically distributed and executed on a large
            cluster of commodity machines. The run-time system takes care of the details of
            splitting the input data, scheduling the program execution across the set of machines,
            handling machine failures and managing the required inter-machine communication. This
            allows programmers without any experience in parallel and distributed systems to easily
            utilize the resources of a large distributed system.  The only requirement is that the
            application should be data parallel in nature.  To utilize the MapReduce framework, a
            programmer must define 2 functions: <emphasis>map</emphasis> and
            <emphasis>reduce</emphasis>. Each function has key-value pairs as its input and
            output. The type of the key and value can be defined by the user. Input data can be in
            any format as long as it can be loaded into key-value pairs by a user defined
            function. The map function takes the input key-value pairs and produces a bag of
            intermediate key-value pairs. The MapReduce library groups together all intermediate
            values associated with the same intermediate key and passes them to the reduce function.
            The reduce function, also written by the programmer, accepts an intermediate key and the
            list of values for that key and processes the values sharing the same key.

        <para>
            Notice that the reduce phase can begin only after all the map tasks are done and
            intermediate files are produced. However, this is the only needed synchronization point
            and the only inter-process communication.
        </para>
        <para>
            The most important features of the MapReduce parallel programming model are: fault
            tolerance and data locality.  The target architecture of the Google MapReduce is a
            cluster of thousands of commodity machines (e.g., 2-4 GB of main memory while networking
            hardware bandwidth is 100 Mbit/s). This means that machine failures are common and
            re-execution of map and/or reduce tasks is the primary mechanism for fault tolerance.
            The data to process that is stored on the disks is managed by a distributed file system,
            <trademark class="registered">GFS</trademark> (Google File System), that uses
            replication to provide availability and reliability on top of unreliable
            hardware. Moreover, the bandwidth is conserved because GFS file blocks are stored on the
            local disks of the machines that make up the Google cluster.  The processing is data
            local because each user defined map function reads the data from the replica stored
            locally on the same machine.
        </para>
        <para>
            Google MapReduce is a C++ library, but an open source implementation in Java also
            exists: <trademark class="registered">Apache</trademark> <trademark
            class="registered">Hadoop</trademark> MapReduce.  Hadoop MapReduce follows the same
            approach taken by Google: the system is in charge of the communication between
            machines. The user must only implement the <emphasis>map</emphasis> and
            <emphasis>reduce</emphasis> functions and run the job specifying the input data and the
            output directory for the results.  Like Google, Hadoop uses its own distributed file
            system, <trademark class="registered">HDFS</trademark> (Hadoop Distributed File System).

            The architecture shown in the <xref linkend="hadoop_mapreduce_execution"/> is quite
            similar to the one used by the ProActive Scheduler to execute ProActive workflows: the
            job is submitted to the ProActive Scheduler, the ProActive Scheduler and the ProActive
            Resource Manager coordinate the execution of the ProActive workflow, the ProActive node
            runs the tasks belonging to the ProActive workflow. This similarity made the
            implementation of ProActive MapReduce possible.

            <para>
                ProActive MapReduce is a framework for execution of MapReduce jobs using the
                infrastructure provided by ProActive Scheduler and ProActive Resource Manager. The
                scheduler and resource manager provide fault tolerance, easy deployment and advanced
                scheduling capabilities not found in Hadoop. There is no distributed file system in
                ProActive though, so the <emphasis>DataSpaces</emphasis> mechanism is used for
                accessing input and writing output data.
            </para>
            <para>
                ProActive MapReduce API is <emphasis>Hadoop-like</emphasis>. The user can define the
                ProActive MapReduce workflow as in Hadoop, but, internally, the ProActive MapReduce
                builds a ProActive job and submits it to ProActive Scheduler. Adapting existing
                Hadoop jobs to execute them using ProActive MapReduce framework is easy. No changes
                are required to the Mapper and Reducer classes; and only minimal amount of
                additional configuration is needed.

                        <para>

                    <listitem>
                        <para>
                            Steps 1-4 of job creation and configuration from the listing above also
                            require no modification.

                    <listitem>
                        <para>
                            Step 5 requires the following modification: input and output paths
                            should be <emphasis>relative to the input and output
                            dataspaces</emphasis>. Assuming we would like to use
                            <literal>$EXAMPLE_DIR/data/input</literal> as an input dataspace, and
                            <literal>$EXAMPLE_DIR/data/output</literal> as an output dataspace
                            (we'll configure the dataspaces in a minute), the input and output paths
                            should look like this:

                            <programlisting language="java">FileInputFormat.addInputPath(job, new Path("input_file");
FileOutputFormat.setOutputPath(job, new Path("output_dir"));</programlisting>

                    <listitem>
                        <para>
                            Apart from that, some ProActive MapReduce-specific configuration is
                            necessary. First, we need to have a configuration file. An example of a
                            configuration file with all possible configuration properties can be
                            found in
                            <literal>$SCHEDULER_HOME/src/scheduler/src/org/ow2/proactive/scheduler/ext/mapreduce/examples/paMapReduceConfigurationProperties.property</literal>. Here
                            we'll use a minimal configuration file sufficient to run the example:

                            <programlisting language="sh"># filename: $EXAMPLE_DIR/paMapReduceConfigurationProperties.property

# scheduler URL
org.ow2.proactive.scheduler.ext.mapreduce.schedulerUrl=rmi://localhost:55855/

# credentials to use when submitting the job
org.ow2.proactive.scheduler.ext.mapreduce.username=admin
org.ow2.proactive.scheduler.ext.mapreduce.password=admin

# dataspaces configuration
org.ow2.proactive.scheduler.ext.mapreduce.workflow.inputSpace=file:///home/user/mapreduce_example/data/input
org.ow2.proactive.scheduler.ext.mapreduce.workflow.outputSpace=file:///home/user/mapreduce_example/data/output

# input split size: the size in bytes of the chunk of data that each
# mapper will get as its input
org.ow2.proactive.scheduler.ext.mapreduce.workflow.splitterPATask.inputSplitSize=10

# additional classpath: here it contains the path to the directory
# where the class files of this example will be put
org.ow2.proactive.scheduler.ext.mapreduce.workflow.classpath=/home/user/mapreduce_example/classes</programlisting>
                        </para>
                        <para>
                            The settings for inputSpace and outputSpace should contain the URIs
                            supported by the DataSpaces mechanism and accessible from all nodes
                            that the job will execute on. In this example, all nodes will be
                            started locally, so we are using the <literal>file://</literal>
                            protocol and the local paths.
                        </para>
                        <para>
                            The inputSplitSize setting determines the size in bytes of the input
                            chunk that each mapper will process, and thus it also determines the
                            total number of mapper tasks. In Hadoop, setting this parameter is
                            usually unnecessary, because by default the split size is equal to
                            the size of an HDFS block, and there is usually no reason to change
                            it. In ProActive MapReduce, any value can be used. Here we set it to
                            a small value, because the size of an input file in this example is
                            going to be small.
                        </para>
                        <para>
                            Setting the number of reducer tasks is done in exactly the same way
                            as it is done in Hadoop: by calling the setNumReduceTasks(int)

            <para>
                The ProActive MapReduce, when the user creates the ProActive MapReduce job and
                before that job is submitted to the ProActive Scheduler, internally builds a
                ProActive workflow made up of five tasks as the <xref
                linkend="proactive_mapreduce_workflow"/> shows: <emphasis>SplitterPATask</emphasis>,
                <emphasis>MapperPATask</emphasis>, <emphasis>MapperJoinPATask</emphasis>,
                <emphasis>ReducerPATask</emphasis> and <emphasis>ReducerJoinPATask</emphasis>. The
                execution order of those tasks and their behavior is the following: the
                <emphasis>SplitterPATask</emphasis> creates the input splits from the input
                file. Each <emphasis>MapperPATask</emphasis> processes one and only one input
                split. To achieve that, MapperPATask is replicated with the replication factor equal
                to the number of created input splits. The <emphasis> MapperJoinPATask</emphasis>
                implements the join of the execution of the MapperPATask
                replicas. <emphasis>ReducerPATask</emphasis> starts its execution only after the
                MapperJoinPATask (and so all the MapperPATask replicas) ends.  The ReducerPATask is
                replicated too. The number of replicas of the ReducerPATask is defined by the
                user. If the user does not define it, only one ReducerPATask is executed. The last
                executed task is the <emphasis>ReducerJoinPATask</emphasis> that implements the join
                of the ReducerPATask replicas.

                            it defines the size, in bytes, of the input split (fragment of the input
                            data) each mapper will get as an input. This configuration property is
                            optional but no default value is defined by the ProActive MapReduce. When
                            the user does not specify the size of the input split then the default value
                            is given by the user-provided Hadoop InputFormat. ProActive MapReduce uses
                            the user specified Hadoop InputFormat class to create input splits and that
                            the size of those input split is equal to a default value computed by the
                            user specified Hadoop InputFormat class.  When the user defines a value of 0
                            (zero) bytes for the size of the input split, then input splits with a size
                            equal to the minimum possible value forecast by the Hadoop InputFormat class
                            used are created. On the other hand, when the user defines a size greater
                            than the size of the input file then only one input split is created and the
                            size of that input split is equal to the size of the input
                            file. Corresponding PAMapReduceJobConfiguration method:

                            are created. The latter means that the input file is left in the ProActive

                There are two main restrictions related to the ProActive MapReduce: it requires Java
                6 and it provides the support only for the <emphasis>Hadoop MapReduce
                0.20.2</emphasis> release and only for the <emphasis role="italics">Hadoop new
                MapReduce API</emphasis> (i.e., the Hadoop MapReduce job must be built using the
                classes defined in the package <emphasis>org.apache.hadoop.mapreduce</emphasis>, not
                <emphasis>org.apache.hadoop.mapred</emphasis>).
            </para>
            <para>
                Moreover, the ProActive MapReduce Hadoop-like API implementation does not support
                many of the advanced Hadoop features, such as reporters, counters, compression,
                distributed cache, debug scripts and speculative execution. Those features, if
                specified during the configuration step, are ignored by the ProActive MapReduce.

                A 20-node cluster was used for the benchmark; the nodes are dual-processor quad-core
                2.00GHz Intel® Xeon E5335 machines with 16 GB of RAM running Fedora 7. 2 machines
                were reserved for running Hadoop JobTracker and HDFS NameNode, the remaining 18 were
                used for TaskTrackers and HDFS DataNodes. Each TaskTracker was configured to run at
                most 6 map tasks during the map phase and 6 reduce tasks during the reduce
                phase. The link between all nodes is 1 GBit ethernet. The size of input split was
                not configured and thus was chosen by Hadoop based on the HDFS block size (64
                MB). The number of reducers was set to 54. Input files were uploaded to the HDFS
                with a replication factor of 3.
