  <title>Component perspectives: a support for advanced research</title>

  <para>The ProActive/Fractal framework is a functional and flexible
  implementation of the Fractal API and model. One can configure and deploy a
  system of distributed components, including Grids. The framework also
  proposes extensions for collective interactions (gathercast and multicast
  interfaces), allocation configuration through virtual nodes extensions, and
  some optimizations.</para>

  <para>It is now a mature framework for developing Grid applications, and as
  such it is a basis for experimenting new research paths.</para>

    <title>Dynamic reconfiguration</title>

    <para>One of the challenges of Grid computing is to handle changes in the
    execution environments, which are not predictable in systems composed of
    large number of distributed components on heterogeneous environments. For
    this reason, the system needs to be dynamically reconfigurable, and must
    exhibit autonomic properties.</para>

    <para><emphasis>Simple and deterministic</emphasis> dynamic
    reconfiguration is a real challenge in systems that contain hierarchical
    components that feature their own activities and that communicate
    asynchronously.</para>

    <para>The <emphasis>autonomic computing</emphasis> paradigm is related to
    this challenge because is consists of building applications out of
    self-managed components. Components which are self-managed are able to
    monitor their environment and adapt to it by automatically optimizing and
    reconfiguring themselves. The resulting systems are autonomous and
    automatically fulfill the needs of the users, but the complexity of
    adaptation is hidden to them. Autonomicity of components represents a key
    asset for large scale distributed computing. We are also</para>

    <title>Model-checking</title>

    <para>Encapsulation properties, components with configurable activities,
    and system description in ADL files provide safe basis for model checking
    of component systems.</para>

    <para>For instance:</para>

        <para>Behavioral information on components can be specified in extended ADL files.</para>

        <para>Automatas can be generated from behavioral information and structural description.</para>

    investigates such kinds of scenarii.</para>

    <title>Pattern-based deployment</title>

    <para>Distributed computational applications are designed by defining a
    functional or do- main decomposition, and these decompositions often
    present structural similarities (master-slave, 2D-Grid, pipeline
    etc.).</para>

    <para>In order to facilitate the design of complex systems with large
    number of entities and recurring similar configurations, we plan to
    propose a mechanism for defining parameterizable assembly patterns in the
    Fractal ADL, particularly for systems that contain parameterized numbers
    of identical components.</para>
  </sect1>

  <sect1 id="perspectives_html_GUI">
    <title>Graphical user interface</title>

    <para>Another area of investigation is the tools for configuring,
    deploying and monitoring distributed component systems.</para>

    <para>Because component based programming is somewhat analogous to the
    assembly of building blocks into a functional product, graphical tools are
    well suited for the design and monitoring of component based systems. The
    Fractal community actually proposes such a tool: the Fractal GUI. We have
    extended this tool to evaluate the feasibility of a full-fledge graphical
    interface for the design and monitoring of distributed components. The
    result is available within the IC2D GUI, you can try it out, but consider
    it as a product in alpha state. Development is indeed currently
    discontinued as we are waiting for a new release of the Fractal GUI, and
    some features are only partially implemented (runtime monitoring,
    composition of virtual nodes).</para>

    <para>The GUI allows the creation of ADL files representing component
    systems, and - the other way around - also allows to load ADL files and
    get a visual representation of systems described in the ADL files. We have
    worked on the manipulation of virtual nodes - a deployment abstraction -:
    components display the virtual nodes where they are deployed, and it is
    also possible to compose virtual nodes</para>

    <para>Ultimately, we would like to couple the visualization of components
    at runtime (currently unavailable here) with the standard monitoring
    capabilities of IC2D: we would get a structural view of the application in
    the Fractal GUI, and a topological view in the standard IC2D.</para>

      <note>
        <para>Since version 3.2 the experimental GUI in IC2D is not functional
        anymore. Developments are discontinued as we are moving towards an
        eclipse plugin integrated with the new eclipse-plugin-based version of
        IC2D. A proposal specification for this new GUI is available <ulink
        url="http://www.objectweb.org/wws/arc/fractal/2004-05/msg00044.html">here</ulink>.
        We intend add extension for Grid-specific features (control of
        deployment, visual abstractions etc.)</para>
