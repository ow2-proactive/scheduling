	You can put in this addons folder jars or classes folders to
be included in the JVM's classpath.  It can be used, for instance, for
the Scheduler server, in order to to define a new scheduling policy.
It can be used, for a node JVM, in order to add user classes needed by
the Java Tasks. For large user (job) classpath, it is recommended to
put the classpath here rather than to transfer it using the job classpath
attribute.
