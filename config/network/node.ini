### Protocols can be 'pnp' (default), 'pamr' (for networks behind firewall)
proactive.communication.protocol=pnp

### PNP Protocol configuration
#proactive.pnp.port=1100

### PAMR Protocol configuration
# If the PAMR router is hosted on a different host
#proactive.pamr.router.address=hal
#proactive.pamr.router.port=33647

### PAMR/SSH Protocol configuration
#proactive.pamr.socketfactory=ssh
#proactive.pamrssh.port=22
#proactive.pamrssh.username=login

# path to the private key on linux :
#proactive.pamrssh.key_directory=/home/login/.ssh
# on windows :
#proactive.pamrssh.key_directory=c:\\Users\\login\\.ssh


### Common network configuration

# When hostname resolution fails, enable the following property to let the scheduler advertise its IP address instead of
# its hostname
#proactive.useIPaddress=true

# disable binding to localhost by default, enable it if binding to localhost is the only option available
proactive.net.nolocal=true

# You can use either one (not both) of the following properties if you want to bind to a specific address or network interface:
#proactive.net.netmask=192.168.0.1/24
#proactive.net.interface=eth0
