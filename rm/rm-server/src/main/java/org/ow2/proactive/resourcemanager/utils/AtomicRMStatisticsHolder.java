/**
 * This class represents a holder of two instances of RMStatistics, two instances 
 * are used because an instance of this class can be potentially manipulated concurrently by
 * multiple threads. In fact, it is a specific case of the single writer and multiple readers
 * situation. The writer updates the statistical data of the first instance and the readers
 * access the statistical data of the second instance. Once the writer has finished 
 * updating it swaps atomically the two instances. The first once becomes the second and the 
 * second is reused for writing.
 * Using such a technique has the advantage of never blocking the writer, keeping the statistical
 * data consistent and avoid useless copies (if using copy-on write technique).
