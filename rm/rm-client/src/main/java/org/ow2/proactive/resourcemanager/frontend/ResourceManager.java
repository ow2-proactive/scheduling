/**
 * This class represents the interface of the resource manager.
 * <p>
 * The resource manager is used to aggregate resources across the network which are represented by ProActive nodes.
 * Its main features are
 * <ul>
 * <li> deployment, acquisition and release of ProActive nodes to/from an underlying infrastructure</li>
 * <li> providing nodes for computations, based on clients criteria (@see {@link SelectionScript})</li>
 * <li> maintaining and monitoring its list of resources and managing their states (free, busy, down...)</li>
 * </ul>
 * <p>
 * This interface provides means to create/remove node sources in the resource manager, add remove nodes to node sources,
 * track the state of the resource manager and get nodes for computations.
 * <p>
 * All the methods of this interface are asynchronous.
